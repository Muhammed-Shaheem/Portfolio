    "Technologies": ["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript", "Git", "GitHub", "Json"],
    "Challenges": "One of the main challenges was making the portfolio and work item pages dynamic. Instead of using backend APIs, I structured the data in JSON files and loaded them at runtime, which taught me how to manage content dynamically. I also built a flexible navigation system with items loading from JSON, ensuring easier updates and scalability. Another challenge was maintaining responsiveness and consistent styling across devices, which improved my understanding of layout and design practices."
