    "About": "Developing a WPF desktop chess application that allows two players to play on the same computer, focusing on building strong game logic to demonstrate problem-solving and programming skills. The application uses coordinate-based calculations to validate piece movements and enforce chess rules, while a dynamic chessboard UI built with WPF Grid and C# renders pieces and updates the board in real-time. Additional features include highlighting possible moves and sound effects.",
